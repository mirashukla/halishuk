1.) Find out how to display a circle in a window
2.) find out to show a 'beam of light' 

    class LightSource:
    def __init__(self, position, direction):
        # Initialize attributes

    def emit_ray(self):
        # Emit a light ray from the light source

3.) research the physics for gravitational lensing in 2d
4.) Maybe look into allowed the user to input values for where the light is shot and mass of object
